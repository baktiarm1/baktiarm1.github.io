     This first project at first sounded daunting but the labs help you prep for it very well. 
We had to us NokoGiri gem to scrape data from our chosen website and organize the data. 
The data had to be organized so it can be served up on the command line interface and is readable. 
Certain sites do not allow Nokogiri  to access their info, due to security concerns. 
Think cambridge analytica. They scraped millions of users facebook data without facebook really stopping them. 
I settled to build something with getting infortmation on vacation packages from Cheapcaribbean.com. 
Pull the destinations that were marketed on its homepage. Then ask the user if it wants details on that destination 
such as name of the resort and the prices. 


      I kind of  worked backwards because I wanted to get into the scraping right away. I used repl.it to make sure the site was accessble and did a proof of concept to identify the css attributes i would need to access the right parts of the site. 
once I had the meat of my project done and i was confident it was going to work I started implementation in objected oriented format. This is where I struggled a bit. Although i understood the concepts, the syntax and nuances of OOP made it a bit hard and intimidating for me. There was plenty of help I watched the videos on how to set up the skeleton code and file formats that was expected of us. Examples of previous projects were a huge help, i couldnt have done it if i did not have the "Worlds Best Restaurant" CLI project to refer to. I modeled my format and file structure after that. Used it as a reference to build my own. As I was building I started to see the difference from mine to it but it served its purpose. Following the project helped me get a understanding how things should workd and I was able to understand how i can implement mine my own way. 

     It was intimidating at first but as I worked through it slowly but surely things came into focus and I was able to complete it!
