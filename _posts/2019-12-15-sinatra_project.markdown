  I like how this program is structured. The necessary peices are taught to you separately and is brought together and tied in perfectly. The difficulties i faced were always usually my own. All the materials were laid out there to be consumed in breaks. I tried to consume them all at once and it was just crammed in my head. Although i got the lessons at the moment for Database connection, ActiveRecrod, CRUD, Authentication and RESTful routes. Tying them together i had difficulty recalling it. All i had to do is go back to them and try to bring it together. Biggest issue though was datbase migration. Active record config, environment gems and structuring the object orientation of that was a bit confusing. I usually focus on getting the code working. Building it from scratch still scares me. Adding evironment rb and config and database connection in buidling the sinatra project, coupled with local machine issues it got frustrating. 
	
	Getting the code done and meeting requirements for me wasnt the difficult part it was more not having a skeleton of the configurations that scared me the most. This is where pair programming becomes useful other engineers will see what you cant so easily. Ultimately its always important to become unblocked through a peer in times you are frustrated.
